# WordHunt

Welcome to WordHunt! A client-based game where you must search a board for consecutive letters in order to create an English word. Inspired by a similar game avaiable on iOS.

### Example:

You have 60 seconds to find as many words as you can on the board.

 | T | W | I | 
 | M | H | T | 
 | F | I | H | 

ANSWER: Possible words:'WIT',  'HIT', 'HIM',  'FIT', 'TWIT', 'WITH' 'WHIT', 'WHIM'

Scrabble scoring is used to determine the score of each word you get.

## Installing

This application is built with Node.js.

Once you have cloned the repo, run 'npm install/yarn run' to install the relevant dependencies.

## Getting Started

When it the main directory, run 'node play.js' to run the game
